# Arduino LED Scarf and Top Hat

## Overview

This art project was for [Kiwiburn](http://kiwiburn.com/) 2016 and 2017,
the regional Burning Man in New Zealand.

## Building

You'll need [Platform.io](http://platformio.org/) to build this (or move some files around to build with the default Arduino IDE).
